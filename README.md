# Personal Assistant OS

> Turn your Obsidian vault into an AI-powered second brain with Claude Code.

A complete personal assistant system where Claude reads your notes, remembers your preferences, manages your tasks, processes meeting transcripts, tracks your goals, and writes in your voice — all through natural conversation.

**Clone. Open in Obsidian. Run `/setup`. Start talking.**

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adriiita/personal-assistant-os.git
cd personal-assistant-os
```

### 2. Open in Obsidian

### 4. Launch Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### 5. Personalize your vault

```
/setup
```

Claude will interview you about your work, preferences, and what you want to track — then build a personalized vault tailored to you.

## Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/setup` | Interactive onboarding — personalizes your entire vault |
| `/resume` | Start a session — loads recent context, pending tasks, work status |
| `/compress` | Save session — creates searchable session log before you close |
| `/preserve` | Save permanent learnings — durable knowledge with auto-archiving |
| `/daily-review` | Morning check-in, evening reflection, or weekly review |

### Daily Workflow

```
Morning:   /resume → /daily-review

During:    Just talk naturally
           "Add a task: finish proposal by Friday"
           "What did we discuss in last week's standup?"
           "Write a YouTube script about personal branding"

Evening:   /compress
           Saves everything for next session
```

## Task Management (TaskNotes)

TaskNotes is the built-in task system. Claude creates and manages tasks via API — you just talk naturally.

### Creating Tasks

```
"Add a task: review the proposal, high priority, due Friday"
"Create a task to prepare for the client meeting tomorrow"
"I need to write the blog post draft by next week"
```

### Managing Tasks

```
"What tasks are overdue?"
"Move 'review proposal' to in-progress"
"Mark the blog post draft as done"
"Show me my tasks for this week"
```

### Built-in Views

TaskNotes comes with 6 views you can open in Obsidian:

| View | What It Shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Task List** | All tasks with 6 tabs (All, Not Blocked, Today, Overdue, This Week, Unscheduled) |
| **Kanban Board** | Visual columns by status (Open → In Progress → Done) |
| **Calendar** | Weekly time grid with tasks on time slots |
| **Mini Calendar** | Month overview with dots for task dates |
| **Agenda** | Flat list of upcoming 7 days |
| **Relationships** | Task dependencies, subtasks, blocking chains |

### Features

- Priorities (none, low, normal, high) with color coding
- Due dates and scheduled dates
- Task dependencies (blocked-by / blocking)
- Time tracking and Pomodoro timer
- Urgency scoring (priority + deadline proximity)
- Tags, contexts, and project grouping

## Meeting Intelligence

### Option 1: Manual Paste (Free)

1. Copy your meeting transcript from Zoom, Google Meet, Fireflies, Otter, etc.
2. Paste it into the chat
3. Claude extracts decisions, action items, and creates a structured summary
4. Offers to create tasks from action items

### Option 2: Fireflies MCP (Business Plan — $19/mo)

1. Connect Fireflies via MCP server
2. Say "sync my meetings"
3. Claude pulls and processes transcripts automatically

Meeting notes are saved to `Meetings/` in the right subfolder (team-standups, client-calls, one-on-ones, general).

---

## Output Styles

Tell Claude how to write, and it switches style:

| Style | Trigger | Example Output |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Conversation** | Default | Natural, concise chat |
| **YouTube Script** | "Write a YouTube script about..." | Hook → Setup → Content → CTA with visual cues |
| **Blog Post** | "Write a blog post about..." | Headline → Intro → Sections → Takeaway |
| **Email** | "Draft an email to..." | Subject → Greeting → Body → CTA → Sign-off |
| **Quick Reply** | "Reply to this DM..." | 1-3 sentences, casual, matches platform |
| **Meeting Summary** | Paste a transcript | Decisions → Action Items → Summary → Follow-up |

Each style is a markdown file in `.claude/output-styles/`. Add your own or customize existing ones.

---

## Goal Tracking

The goal cascade connects your long-term vision to daily actions:

```
3-Year Vision → Yearly Goals → Projects → Monthly Goals → Weekly Review → Daily Tasks
```

- Goals live in `Goals/` (vision.md, yearly-goals.md, monthly-goals.md)
- Projects in `Projects/` link to goals
- Tasks link to projects via TaskNotes
- Weekly reviews flag goals that have no active project

---

## Memory System

### How Claude Remembers

Three mechanisms work together:

1. **Hooks** (automatic) — Every conversation turn, hooks inject your memory and remind Claude to update it
2. **Session Logs** (`/compress`) — Structured summaries of past work sessions with Quick Reference sections for fast AI scanning
3. **Permanent Memory** (`/preserve`) — Durable knowledge that persists indefinitely with auto-archiving

### Memory Files

| File | What It Stores |
|------|---------------|
| `learnings.md` | Insights, patterns, things that worked or failed |
| `user_preferences.md` | Communication style, work habits, tool preferences |
| `user_projects.md` | Active projects, deadlines, key details |
| `work_status.md` | What happened this session, pending items, next steps |

### The Teaching Loop

When you correct Claude:
1. It applies the correction immediately
2. Asks: "Should I save this as a permanent rule?"
3. If yes → adds the rule to CLAUDE.md
4. Never makes that mistake again

Over time, the system learns exactly how you like things done.

---

## Privacy & Safety

**Important**: Claude Code sends your vault content to Anthropic's servers for processing.

### Protect Yourself

- **`.claudeignore`** — Already included. Add paths to folders Claude should never read
- **Keep secrets outside** — Passwords, API keys, credentials should not be in the vault
- **Version control** — Use `git init` and commit regularly
- **Review changes** — Check what Claude creates before committing

### What's Included

```
.claudeignore     → Excludes sensitive folders from Claude's access
.gitignore        → Ready for git, excludes OS files and plugin binaries
```

## For Claude Co-Work Users

This system works in both Claude Code and Claude Co-Work, with different capabilities:

| Feature | Claude Code | Co-Work |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Read/write files | Yes | Yes |
| CLAUDE.md instructions | Yes | Yes |
| Memory hooks (auto-update) | Yes | No |
| Slash commands | Yes | No |
| TaskNotes API | Yes | No |
| Skills | Yes | No |

**Co-Work workaround**: Manually tell Claude to "check my memory files" at the start and "update my work status" at the end of each session.

---

## Customization

### Add Your Own Output Style

Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/output-styles/` following the pattern:

```markdown
# Style Name

## Identity
Who are you when writing in this style?

## Tone
What's the emotional register?

## Format
What's the structural template?

## Rules
What must you always/never do?
```

### Add a New Skill

Create a folder in `.claude/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill
description: What it does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill

USE WHEN the user...

## How It Works
[Instructions for Claude]
```

### Modify Folder Structure

The `/setup` command builds folders based on your interview answers. You can always:
- Add new folders manually
- Create `_guide.md` files in any folder to teach Claude what goes there
- Update the vault structure section in `CLAUDE.md`
