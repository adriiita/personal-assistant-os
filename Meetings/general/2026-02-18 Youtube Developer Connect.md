## Discussion Summary

### AI Tool Assessments
The team evaluated the Figma conversion tool and Sonet 4.6 model for potential use in website design and cost-effectiveness. These were considered as both internal tools and potential video topics for the YouTube channel.

### Cowork Course & Community Engagement
A structured Cowork course was designed with a focus on skill-building and effective community participation. Milan will lead content recording using Ben's existing material and prepare additional in-depth modules.

### Website Redesign & Webflow Migration
A new website demo was built using AI-generated content. Prabha will complete design fixes and animations before the site is migrated to Webflow for easier long-term maintenance. Oskar will handle copy review.

### Three-Layer Skills Architecture
A proposed three-layer skills architecture was discussed to improve workflow automation and allow deeper customisation. Dynamic skill creation and management were identified as the core enablers of scalability.

### Video Pipeline Optimisation
The content pipeline in Notion was reviewed and prioritised. The team committed to keeping briefs, outlines, and demo materials well-organised to reduce delays and improve collaboration across roles.

## Open Questions
- Webflow migration timeline — Prabha to confirm readiness
- Sales use case video sequencing — Ben, Sharique, and Aryan to align
- Thumbnail brief quality — ongoing feedback loop needed

## Follow-up
- Next meeting: Recurring (Youtube Developer Connect series)
- Items to prepare: Loom demos from Aryan and Agniva; updated Notion pipeline; design elements from Prabha; thumbnail briefs clarified
