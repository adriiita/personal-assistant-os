## Discussion Summary

### YouTube as Priority Revenue & Growth Channel
Ben emphasised building on past successes, particularly a previous AI video that generated significant revenue. With recent videos accounting for 10% of yearly views, the team aligned on YouTube as the primary lever for both community growth and monetisation.

### Community Restructure: Milan Takes Lead
Milan was formally assigned ownership of the Cowork community project, including course rollout. Naveed's role shifts to supporting workshops and 1:1s as community management responsibility transfers.

### Sales Plugin Progress
Aryan and Naveed are continuing to develop the sales plugin, which processes leads efficiently. The goal is demo readiness, with a video planned once validation is complete.

### Thumbnail Design Overhaul
Sharique will onboard thumbnail designers with proper briefs, packaging guidelines, and video titles. This addresses ongoing quality issues and aims to improve engagement metrics.

### Skill Engineering Video Series
Ben will lead a series focused on "skill engineering" and agent use cases. Content will balance quality with speed, given rising competition in the AI content space.

## Open Questions
- Sales plugin timeline — Aryan and Naveed to confirm demo readiness date
- Website landing page content — Prabha to coordinate with Milan and Ben
- Community course rollout plan — Milan to define timeline

## Follow-up
- Next meeting: Recurring (Youtube Developer Connect series)
- Items to prepare: Thumbnail designer onboarding completed by Sharique; sales plugin demo validation ongoing; community roadmap from Milan
