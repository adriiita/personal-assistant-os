# Thinking

This is where your synthesis and original ideas live. Not reference material — your own thoughts.

## What Goes Here
- Personal reflections and synthesis
- Ideas you're developing
- Thinking patterns and mental models
- Decisions and reasoning
- Brain dumps that you've processed into structured thoughts

## How to Write Notes
- Each note should be standalone — understandable without reading others
- Weave [[wiki links]] into your sentences: "Because [[quality matters more than speed]], I should..."
- Use YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: thinking
title: Note Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

## Naming Convention
Use descriptive titles that capture the core idea:
- `Quality matters more than speed.md`
- `Why I switched to Obsidian.md`
- `My framework for making decisions.md`
