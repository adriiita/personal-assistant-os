# Meeting: Youtube Developer Connect

## Key Decisions
- Shift towards in-depth, skill-based videos; tutorial content to be limited to improve quality
- Video topics to target a broader audience, focusing on skills to facilitate AI adoption
- Ben designated as final decision-maker for approving video ideas
- Idea validation process formalised to optimise content pipeline management
- Video categories established: tutorials, use cases, and updates (kept separate)
- Hands-on trials initiated to convert existing N8N automations into Claude skills

## Action Items
- [ ] Prepare and record two videos on current scheduling constraints — **Owner**: Ben Van Sprundel — **Due**: Saturday posting schedule
- [ ] Maintain and share a categorised content framework accessible to the team — **Owner**: Ben Van Sprundel — **Due**: ASAP

- [ ] Collaborate to experiment converting N8N automations to Claude skills; share findings — **Owner**: Sm Sharique & Adrita Mahata — **Due**: TBD
- [ ] Assist with technical exploration of exporting/importing session data for workflow sharing demos — **Owner**: Naveed Harri — **Due**: TBD
- [ ] Move video ideas with briefs through pipeline for Ben's approval pre-meeting — **Owner**: Team — **Due**: Before each meeting
- [ ] Continue hands-on experimentation and refining briefs — **Owner**: All team members — **Due**: Ongoing

## Discussion Summary

### AI Advances: Gemini 3 & Blockchain Limitations
The team discussed significant advancements in AI, particularly Google's Gemini 3, and noted limitations in blockchain technology regarding credit card use. These were framed as potential video topics given audience interest.

### Content Strategy Shift
A decisive move was made away from surface-level tutorials toward in-depth, skill-based content. The goal is to facilitate AI adoption at a deeper level. Ben will serve as the sole approver for ideas, reducing pipeline bottlenecks.

### Video Categorisation & Idea Validation
A clear categorisation system was established (tutorials, use cases, updates) with an emphasis on estimating preparation time for each idea. All briefs must go through Ben's approval before the team invests significant effort.

### N8N to Claude Skills Conversion
Hands-on trials were initiated to convert existing N8N automations into Claude skills, improving video content accuracy and relevance. Sharique, Adrita, and Aryan will lead these experiments and document findings.

## Open Questions
- Preparation time estimation process — to be formalised
- N8N-to-skills conversion findings — Aryan, Sharique, Adrita to report back

## Follow-up
- Next meeting: Recurring (Youtube Developer Connect series)
- Items to prepare: Ideas with briefs submitted for Ben's approval; N8N conversion experiments begun; content framework shared in team space
