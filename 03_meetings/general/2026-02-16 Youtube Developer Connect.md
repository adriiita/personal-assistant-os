## Discussion Summary

### Structured Ideation Process
The team agreed that a lack of structure in idea generation was slowing the pipeline. All ideas must now be documented in a shared platform (Notion) for transparency. Designated ideation roles will reduce cognitive load and improve follow-through.

### Video Brief Quality & Demo Preparation
Quick brief development and demo preparation were identified as the critical path for maintaining publishing momentum. The team agreed that demos need to be ready before recording sessions to avoid delays.

### Skill-Building Tutorials as Audience Strategy
Skill-building tutorials were highlighted as the most effective content for engaging a technically-minded audience and facilitating AI adoption. These will be balanced with use-case and update content.

### Technical Integrations in Demos
Product demos will increasingly feature technical integrations (sub-agents, MCP, plugin workflows) to showcase the platform's capabilities authentically. Naveed and Aditya will coordinate on lead list qualification demo scope.

### Communication & Workflow Streamlining
A new Slack channel for AI news updates was proposed by Oskar. Adrita will be the primary daily contributor of market and Anthropic updates to keep the team informed without sprawling communication.

## Open Questions
- Sub-agent integration demo scope — Aryan and Naveed to align tonight
- Skills vs Agents distinction for video content — Aditya to clarify with team
- Cron jobs exploration in Cowork — Adrita to explore and report back

## Follow-up
- Next meeting: Recurring (Youtube Developer Connect series)
- Items to prepare: Sub-agent demo ready (Aryan + Naveed); ideation entries updated in Notion; Slack channel for updates created by Oskar
