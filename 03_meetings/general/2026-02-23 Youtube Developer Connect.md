## Discussion Summary

### Video Production Pipeline Simplification
The team redesigned the content production pipeline to include daily ideation and idea filtering. The two-type content structure (new features/tools vs. business use cases) aims to improve efficiency and output consistency, targeting three videos per week.

### Role Clarity & Demo Ownership
Technical team members will handle technical videos while others focus on business use cases. Ben's visual responsibilities were separated to ensure more authentic demos, with clearer handoffs for demo creation.

### Thumbnail & Scheduling Issues
Thumbnail design issues were identified as a blocker. Interim solutions were approved to maintain the release schedule while longer-term fixes are coordinated with the designer.

### Sub-Agents in AI Workflows
The team discussed creating sub-agents within AI workflows to enhance scalability. This will also feed into future video content around AI agent capabilities.

## Open Questions
- Briefing format for Agniva — Ben to provide clarification questions
- Pipeline template setup — Oskar and Agniva to coordinate

## Follow-up
- Next meeting: Recurring daily (Youtube Developer Connect series)
- Items to prepare: Video briefs reviewed and filtered; pipeline template drafted by Oskar
