# Projects

Active project folders. Each project gets its own subfolder.

## What Goes Here
- A folder per active project
- Each folder has a `README.md` with project overview
- Supporting files: research, notes, drafts, assets

## Folder Structure Per Project
```
02_projects/
└── project-name/
    ├── README.md          # Project overview, status, key details
    ├── research/          # Research and reference material
    ├── notes/             # Working notes
    └── drafts/            # Draft content (if applicable)
```
