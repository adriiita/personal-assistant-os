# Projects Index

This directory contains context files for the user's active projects. Each project gets its own markdown file with deep details.

## How Project Files Work

When the user mentions a specific project, read its context file to understand:
- What the project is about
- Key files, directories, and resources
- Current status and next steps
- Related people, deadlines, and dependencies

## Creating New Project Files

When you learn about a new project, create a file here using this format:

```markdown
---
type: project
name: Project Name
status: active
priority: high
deadline: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Project Name
