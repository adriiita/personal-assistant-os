You are saving the current session before the user ends their work. Your job is to preserve everything valuable so future sessions can pick up seamlessly.

## Step 1: Ask What to Preserve

Present a checklist to the user:

"Before we wrap up, what should I save from this session?"

- [ ] **Key learnings** — Insights, things that worked or didn't
- [ ] **Decisions made** — Important choices and reasoning
- [ ] **Solutions & fixes** — Problems solved, workarounds found
- [ ] **Files modified** — What was created, edited, or moved
- [ ] **Pending tasks** — Things still to do
- [ ] **Errors & workarounds** — Issues encountered and how they were handled
- [ ] **All of the above** (recommended)

If the user says "all" or "everything" or just wants to move fast, save everything.

## Step 2: Create Session Log

Create a session log file at:
`.claude/context/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm-topic.md`

Use this format:

```markdown
---
type: session-log
date: YYYY-MM-DD
time: HH:MM
topics: [topic1, topic2]
projects: [Project Name]
outcome: Brief one-line summary
---

# Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — [Topic Summary]

## Quick Reference
**Topics:** [comma-separated list]
**Projects:** [related projects]
**Outcome:** [what was accomplished]
**Duration:** [approximate time spent]

## Decisions Made
- [Decision 1 — reasoning]
- [Decision 2 — reasoning]

## Key Learnings
- [Learning 1]
- [Learning 2]

## Solutions & Fixes
- [Problem → Solution]

## Files Modified
- [file path — what changed]

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]

## Errors & Workarounds
- [Error → Workaround]

---

## Raw Session Summary
[Condensed summary of the full conversation — enough context to understand what happened without reading the raw transcript. Include key exchanges, not verbatim dialogue.]
```

### Important: The Quick Reference Section

The Quick Reference is designed for AI scanning. When `/resume` runs in a future session, it reads Quick Reference sections first (fast, low token cost). Only if more detail is needed does it dig into the full log.

Keep Quick Reference to 5-6 lines max.

## Step 3: Update Memory Files

Based on what was preserved:

- **Learnings** → Append to `.claude/context/memory/learnings.md`
- **User preferences discovered** → Update `.claude/context/memory/user_preferences.md`
- **Project updates** → Update `.claude/context/memory/user_projects.md`
- **Pending tasks** → Create in TaskNotes via API: `curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/tasks" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Task", "status": "open"}'`

## Step 4: Update Work Status

Update `.claude/context/memory/work_status.md`:

```markdown
## Current Session
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Focus**: [what we worked on]
- **Completed**: [list]
- **Pending**: [list]
- **Next Steps**: [what to do next time]
```

Move the previous "Current Session" to "Recent Sessions" (keep last 5).

## Step 5: Check Memory Size

If `.claude/context/memory/learnings.md` exceeds 150 lines:
- Archive older entries to `.claude/context/memory/archive/learnings-archive-YYYY-MM.md`
- Keep only the most recent and most important entries in the main file

## Step 6: Confirm

Tell the user:
- What was saved and where
- Summary of pending tasks
- "You're safe to close. I'll remember everything next time you run /resume."
