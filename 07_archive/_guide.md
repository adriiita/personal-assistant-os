# Archive

Completed or inactive content. The graveyard for things that are done but worth keeping.

## What Goes Here
- Completed projects (moved from `02_projects/`)
- Old daily notes (batch archive during monthly cleanup)
- Finished tasks cleared from the Kanban board
- Deprecated reference material
- Anything you don't need actively but might want later

## When to Archive
- During weekly reviews: move completed tasks here
- When a project is finished: move the entire project folder here
- Monthly: batch archive old daily notes older than 30 days

## Tips
- Archived content is still searchable — nothing is lost
- Don't delete unless you're certain you'll never need it
- Keep the archive organized with subfolders mirroring the main structure:
  - `07_archive/projects/` for old projects
  - `07_archive/daily/` for old daily notes
