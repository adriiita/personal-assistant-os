# Daily

Daily journals, morning check-ins, evening reflections, and weekly reviews.

## How to Use

Run `/daily-review` in Claude to start a routine. Claude will:
1. Check your TaskNotes and recent activity
2. Ask you a few questions
3. Create a daily note here

## File Types

| Evening reflection | `YYYY-MM-DD Evening.md` | End of day |
