# Inbox

This is your capture zone. Drop anything here with zero friction.

## What Goes Here
- Quick thoughts, ideas, notes
- Things you'll organize later
- Links, screenshots, random captures
- Anything that doesn't have a clear home yet

## How to Use
1. Drop it here
2. During your daily or weekly review, process items:
   - Move to the right folder
   - Turn into a task on the Kanban board
   - Archive if no longer relevant
3. Keep the inbox empty (or close to it)

## Naming Convention
No strict rules. Name it whatever makes sense in the moment.

## Tips
- The inbox should be a temporary holding area, not a graveyard
- If something stays here more than a week, it either needs to move or be deleted
